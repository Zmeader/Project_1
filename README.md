#We want to merge both datasets together based on the address and Zip Code (insure the address is correct format for both)
#Outcome: DataFrame

#We want to use google maps to create a ranking system of how good/bad a resturant is
#Change the color of the pointers to match (Create bins where each rest will be based on determined criteria)
# Outcome: gmaps with the following criteria for pointer color. 
# Red = Poor rating + Failed Health
# Green = Great rating + Passed
# Yellow = Poor Rating + Passed
# Orange/Green = Great rating + Failed

#Create a dataframe to seperate fail vs passed resturants
#Create a coorlation between Zip code and Pass/Fail to see if there is a relationship
#Outcome: scatter plot with a regression line for pass and for fail

#compare price value to rating 
#Outcome: scatter plot

#compare price value to zip code
#Outcome: gmaps
